              Pacquiao had a 15-bout winning streak that came to an abrupt end
              <br />in June 2012 when he lost his WBO welterweight title to
              Timothy<br />
              Bradley in a controversial split decision. In December 2012 he
              lost<br />
              a non-title bout to Juan Manuel Márquez—against whom Pacquiao
              <br />had previously won two fights and drawn another—when he
              was<br />knocked out in the sixth round. It was the first time
              Pacquiao had <br />been knocked out since Singsurat did so in
              1999. He regained the <br />WBO welterweight belt in April 2014 by
              beating Bradley in a <br />unanimous decision. Pacquiao's next
              major bout was against the<br />
              undefeated Floyd Mayweather in May 2015, a much-anticipated<br />
              contest that the two fighters' camps had been negotiating on and
              off<br />
              for more than six years. In that event, Pacquiao was unable to
              mount<br />
              an effective offense against Mayweather, who was arguably the
              greatest <br />defensive fighter of his generation, and he lost by
              unanimous decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              After having won a decision over Bradley on April 9, 2016,
              Pacquiao<br />
              retired from boxing for four months before announcing another
              fight.<br />
              On July 2, 2017, he lost a decision and the WBO welterweight title
              to <br />Australia's Jeff Horn. Pacquiao bounced back to capture
              the WBA <br />welterweight title in a victory over Lucas Matthysse
              on July 15, 2018. <br />On July 20, 2019, he won a split decision
              over the previously undefeated<br />
              Keith Thurman to take the WBA super welterweight belt and become,
              <br />at 40 years old, the oldest welterweight champion in boxing
              history.<br />
              However, due to inactivity, in 2021 Pacquaio was stripped of the
              belt, <br />which was then given to Yordenis Ugás of Cuba. Later
              that year he fought<br />
              Ugás and lost by unanimous decision. Pacquiao subsequently
              announced his<br />
              retirement from boxing with a career record of 62 wins, 8 losses,
              and 2 draws.<br />
