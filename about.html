              Pacquiao left home as a teenager and stowed away on a ship bound
              for Manila,<br />
              where he became a boxer. He made his professional debut as a
              junior flyweight<br />
              on January 22, 1995, at the age of 16. Many of his early bouts
              were televised<br />
              on a program called Blow by Blow, where his all-action style and
              boyish smile<br />
              quickly made him a favourite with Filipino boxing fans. He won his
              first major<br />
              title on December 4, 1998, knocking out Thailand's Chatchai
              Sasakul to capture <br />
              the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight title. After failing to
              make weight,<br />
              however, he lost the title to Medgoen Singsurat of Thailand in
              September 1999.<br />
              Pacquiao moved up in weight class, and on June 23, 2001, in his
              first fight in the<br />
              United States, he scored a sixth-round knockout of Lehlo Ledwaba
              to win the<br />
              International Boxing Federation (IBF) junior featherweight title.
              Following four<br />
              successful defenses, he knocked out Mexico's Marco Antonio Barrera
              on <br />November 15, 2003, to become The Ring magazine
              featherweight champion. <br />(The Editors of Encyclopaedia
