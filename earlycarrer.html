              Over the next several years, Pacquiao engaged in a series of
              high-profile fights, winning<br />
              the World Boxing Association (WBA) and IBF featherweight titles,
              the WBC and The<br />
              Ring's junior lightweight titles, and the WBC lightweight title.
              His rise was aided by<br />
              American trainer Freddie Roach, who gradually transformed the
              left-handed slugger into <br />a multifaceted boxer without
              detracting from his natural aggression or punching power.<br />
              He was the Boxing Writers Association of America and The Ring's
              Fighter of the Year in<br />
              2006 and 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
              On December 6, 2008, Pacquiao faced and thrashed American boxing
              star Oscar De La<br />
              Hoya in a celebrated nontitle welterweight bout in Las Vegas. By
              then Pacquiao had <br />become a complete fighter, combining
              excellent footwork, blazing speed, and a vastly<br />
              improved defense, and he was widely considered, pound for pound,
              the world's finest<br />
              boxer. In addition, Pacquiao's popularity as a pay-per-view (PPV)
              boxing attraction had<br />
              increased steadily since 2002, but the match with De La Hoya was
              his breakthrough as a<br />
              global phenomenon. The fight sold approximately 1.25 million buys,
              generating roughly<br />
              $70 million in PPV revenue, one of the largest PPV grosses in
              history for a nonheavyweight.
            </p>
            <p>
              On May 2, 2009, Pacquiao won The Ring's junior welterweight
              championship (his sixth<br />
              weight class as a champion and his ninth as a professional boxer)
              with a spectacular <br />one-punch second-round knockout of
              England's Ricky Hatton. On November 14 he added<br />
              another championship belt—in a record seventh weight class—when he
              defeated Miguel<br />
              Cotto of Puerto Rico in 12 rounds to take the World Boxing
              Organization (WBO) <br />welterweight title. Pacquiao defended
              that title on March 13, 2010, in Arlington, Texas,<br />
              by defeating Ghanaian boxer Joshua Clottey in 12 rounds. He
              increased his weight-class<br />
              titles record to eight when, on November 13, 2010, he soundly
              defeated WBC super<br />
              welterweight champion Antonio Margarito, who outweighed Pacquiao
              by 17 pounds at<br />
              the time of the fight. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica,
