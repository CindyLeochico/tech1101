              In 2003 Pacquiao was voted Person of the Year in the Philippines
              <br />over Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was then two years into
              her<br />
              term as president of the country. Four years later, in 2007, he<br />
              unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the national legislature. He
              then<br />
              returned to boxing full-time, but a few days after his November<br />
              2009 bout he formed a new “local” political party, the Peoples'<br />
              Champ Movement, back in the Philippines. He again declared his<br />
              candidacy for a legislative seat, for a district in Mindanao,
              and,<br />
              on May 10, 2010, he won by an overwhelming margin. He was<br />
              reelected to the post in 2013. On May 9, 2016, Pacquiao was
              <br />one of 12 new senators elected to the Philippine Senate. In
              2021<br />
              he announced his candidacy in the presidential election, which<br />
              was held the following year. Pacquiao conceded after finishing<br />
              a distant third behind the landslide victor, Ferdinand
              (“Bongbong”)<br />
              Marcos, Jr., and second-place Leni Robredo. Also in 2022
              Pacquiao's<br />
              term in the Senate ended.<br />
